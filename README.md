This is a project for Data340: Natural Language Processing

## Introduction
Gender Stereotypes has been widely found in 

The goal of this project is to create a pipeline which takes an input such as a novel/script and tells audiences if it can meet certain standards that are used to evaluate whether the piece portrays women with gender stereotypes and sexist ideas. I am going to use the Bechdel test for this project. To pass the Bechdel test, this piece must feature at least two women who conduct meaningful conversations(conversations such as “Good morning” are not considered meaningful) and their conversations concern something other than men.
